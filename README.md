Identification and Estimation in Judicial Panel Voting

We use a trivariate probit model for the voting behavior of 
members of judicial panels for the cases heard in the US Courts of Appeals.
The model includes covariates, to describe the judge's characteristics; 
peer effects, from taking into account the characteristics of the other judges; 
and dissent aversion, which will test whether the decision of a particular judge 
is influenced by the decisions of the other two judges on the panel.

## ```feasibility:``` Simulation Evidence for a Feasibility Analysis

We conducted some simulations to verify that the 
parameters of the econometric model are identified.
